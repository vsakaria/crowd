A team project with 3 members.

My contribution consisted of the testing of a searches model, construction of the searches model and controller, setting upif the Rdio SWFObject, The Rdio callback and the creation of the Rdio player.

I used the Rdio Javascript Api to import a Flash SWFObject which streamed music from the Rdio servers. I then used the Rdio jQuery library to manage playback. I also used UJS to make Ajax calls using rails remote helpers.
